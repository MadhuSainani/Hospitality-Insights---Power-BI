# Hospitality Insights-PowerBI

## Project Overview:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple 5-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a Data Analyst, my objective was to regain their market share and revenue by creating dashboard aligned with stakeholder expectations. This project leveraged tools such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI to derive actionalble insights from real-world data provided by the organization.

## Mock-up Dashboard:

## What did I do?
- Utilized Power Query to transform data into a format suitable for data analysis.
- Utilized New Card visual for Revenue, RevPAR (Revenue per available room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), ADR (Average Daily Rate), Realization %, and Occupancy %. The new card visual also shows the WoW (week over week) % change for all metrics. To make it more user-friendly, I added accent bars and corresponding arrows that indicate increases and decreases with appropriate colours.
- Created tooltip for Revenue, RevPAR, DSRN, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realization % to visualize the trends for all weeks.
- Created a Matrix visual displaying key metrics for each hotel and room class. Additionally, I added a tooltip showing Revenue, Occupancy %, and ADR trends on hover.
- Utilized a line and stacked column chart to display Realization % and ADR across different booking channels, which enable better comparison of price variations.
- Created a donut chart to display revenue contributions from weekends and weekdays. Additionally, I added a field parameter that allows the chart to display revenue contributions by Luxury and Business class categories.

## Strategic Recommendations:
1. Pricing Strategy: The line chart featured in the report indicates that AtliQ Grand maintains constant Average Daily Rate (ADR), suggesting a static pricing strategy. This situation offers an opening to adopt dynamic pricing strategy to reclaim potential revenue.
2. Promotional Discounts: The report shows that AtliQ's offline booking channel has the highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) compared to their online channels. Since they do not pay commission on offline bookings, they can potentially improve revenue by offering promotional discounts, such as complimentary nights or drinks.
3. Ratings Improvement: This report shows strong +ve correlation between ratings and occupancy %. Hotels with lowest ratings have low occupancy, highlighting an opportunity for rating improvement efforts.
